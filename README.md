MasterOfThieves
===============

Master of Thieves was a game written for my four week long game design course.  The game was put together by a group of
three of us who contributed in different ways.  Although nearly all of the sprites (except the character, bricks, and spikes)
are copyrighted, we decided in this version to be a tribute to Nintendo and have some fun.  I'll upload the game design
document at a later time, which contains everything you would need concerning all of this.

Currently
---------
* Currently am fixing up level loading and music / themes depending on instance.
* attempting to move completely away from global variables

Issues
------
Known issues include:
* Music not playing
* Failing to load level / theme
* Deaths are handled in a crappy way (globals)
* others I cannot remember

I forgot GitHub had a wiki and I am to lazy to copy one wiki to another, so if you would like to, you can find the wiki
