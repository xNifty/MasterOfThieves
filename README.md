MasterOfThieves
===============

Master of Thieves was a game written for my four week long game design course.  The game was put together by a group of
three of us who contributed in different ways.  Although nearly all of the sprites (except the character, bricks, and spikes)
are copyrighted, we decided in this version to be a tribute to Nintendo and have some fun.  I'll upload the game design
document at a later time, which contains everything you would need concerning all of this.

Currently
---------
* Attempting further cleaning of game class
* looking for way to move key handling to a different class and out of the game class; probably move to player class

Issues
------
Known issues include:
* n/a at the moment
