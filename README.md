MasterOfThieves
===============
Master of Thieves was a game written for my four week long game design course.  The game was put together by a group of
three of us who contributed in different ways over a course of three days.  Originally a "tribute to Nintendo", all sprites
and themes (music) have been replaced with custom sprites and a custom theme (more to come in time).

Issues
------
* Game always registers player as "jumping" - makes using animations hard

Important
----------
Please note: this game uses some rather bad coding styles, and was written over three years ago in three days.  It was a fun experience, but I'm under the impression (from the last time I tried to run this code), that it no longer works with newer versions of pygame.
